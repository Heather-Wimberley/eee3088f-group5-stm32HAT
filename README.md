A HAT design to be added to the STM32 microcontroller.

## Proximity and Temperature Sensing HAT

Our HAT will consist of a temperature, humidity and proximity sensor. These sensors will allow for our HAT to provide the device it is attached to with useful parameters of its environment. The device we would attach our HAT to would be a water dispenser. The proximity sensor will be able to detect when a glass is in position to be filled and the temperature sensor will help to keep the waterâ€™s temperature consistent.

## Contents
This repo contains all files needed to understand the functionality of the HAT as well as have the HAT built.
