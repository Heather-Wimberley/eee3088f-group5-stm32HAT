A HAT design to be added to the STM32 microcontroller.

## Proximity and Temperature Sensing HAT

Our HAT will include a temperature and proximity sensor. These sensors will allow for our HAT to provide the device it is attached to with useful parameters of its environment. The device we will be attaching our HAT to is the STM32 Discovery Microcontroller. The scenario we would use our HAT in would be to create efficient water dispensers. The proximity sensor will be able to detect when a bottle/hand is in position to receive water and the temperature sensor will help to monitor the waterâ€™s temperature. Other scenarios our HAT could be used in include drones, cars and automatic sliding doors
